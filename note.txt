### 1) `shoulder < elbow < wrist`

**Suggested name:** **wrist-dominant / wrist-leading** posture
**What it means physically:** each successive joint (from base → wrist) contributes more to the tool angle — the wrist is the most bent. The hand orientation is achieved mainly by the wrist rather than by shoulder/elbow.
**Typical geometry:** more local bending near the end-effector, more compact/fine positioning of the gripper.
**When to use:** precision pick/place (top-down or tight alignment), fine orientation adjustments, when you want the shoulder to stay low or fixed.
**Pros:** good local control of orientation; lower shoulder motion; fine approach to small targets.
**Cons:** less clearance, wrist may approach joint limits, contact forces at the wrist can be larger.

### 2) `shoulder > elbow > wrist`

**Suggested name:** **shoulder-dominant / elbow-leading** posture
**What it means physically:** the base/shoulder provides most of the orientation; wrist is least bent. The arm is more “extended” or arched, using upstream joints to reach.
**Typical geometry:** larger shoulder/elbow excursions, forearm extended, wrist nearly neutral.
**When to use:** pushing/pulling from sides, reaching around obstacles, tasks needing clearance or stiffness at the tool (forceful interactions).
**Pros:** more clearance, better leverage and stiffness for contact tasks, less wrist torque.
**Cons:** larger shoulder torques, possibly less precise local orientation control.

### Important caveats

* These labels depend on your **joint sign convention** and whether you compare raw angles or absolute magnitudes. When I say “dominant” I mean the joint has the largest **contribution** (magnitude) to the final tool pitch.
* **Elbow-up / elbow-down** is a *geometric* property (where the elbow sits relative to the shoulder→wrist line) and **cannot** always be inferred from a simple numeric ordering of angles.
* Use these as **heuristics**, not invariants. The same Cartesian goal can be achieved by many orderings.

### Practical suggestion

Classify postures by:

1. dominance = `abs(angle)` ordering (to know which joint contributes most), and
2. the geometric elbow test (signed cross product / perpendicular distance from shoulder→wrist line) to decide elbow-up vs elbow-down.
